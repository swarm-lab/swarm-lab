                    The SwarmLab was featured today in a New York Times article by Joshua Sokol discussing the science fiction myth that disabling the “queen” of a swarm will immediately lead its collapse (it doesn’t!). You can read it all in “Striking Down the Queen Won’t Save You From the Swarm”.

Contact Calls Facilitate Group Contraction in Free-ranging Goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution 7, 73. doi:10.3389/fevo.2019.00073  Abstract: Many social animal species produce vocalizations believed to facilitate group contraction when one or more group members have become distant. However, the mechanisms underlying this function remain unclear for many species. We examined this question with data on a semi-free ranging group of 16 adult domesticated goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) inhabiting Tsaobis Nature...

The goal of this workshop is to provide researchers coming from mathematics, physics, engineering and biology with experience in working collaboratively to model and analyze data produced by research in collective behavior. This year we are also including an interdisciplinary art/science project (see Project 4 below) that will use virtual reality to explore and interact with data and models of collective behaviors. All information about the workshop, including application instructions and deadline, can be found...

                    How do organisms without brains make decisions? Most of life is brainless and the vast majority of organisms on Earth lack neurons altogether. Plants, fungi and bacteria must all cope with the same problem as humans – to make the best choices in a complex and ever-changing world or risk dying – without the help of a simple nervous system in many cases. Our lab in collaboration with Richard Mann (University of Leeds), James Marshall (University of Sheffield) and Tanya Latty (University of Sydney) recently studied this problem in the unicellular slime mold, <a...

Among other things she will outfit local goats with GPS collars coupled with small microphones, that she just spent a month and a half patiently building in Swansea, where the SHOAL group of our collaborator Andrew King resides. While in the train toward London Heathrow, she overheard a dad reading a story to his son, a...

                    We are currently seeking a postdoctoral researcher to lead:  the development and testing of spatially explicit models of criminal activities; the production of a forecasting software application to provide decision support for policing.   This is a 1+1 year position (funding in the 2nd year will depend on progress in the 1st year) based out of Newark, New Jersey. This position is supported by a Rutgers-Newark Initiative for Multidisciplinary Research Teams (IMRT) award and is expected to be extended beyond the 2 year initial period through local and federal funding.

                    The Swarm Lab will be 3 year old tomorrow, July 1st, 2015. To celebrate the event, I decided to redo our website from scratch. It has now a new interface and, more importantly, a new backend. Goodbye Wordpress, and hello Jekyll!!!    I have wanted to make this move for a long time now. Wordpress has served me very well for many years but I have grown increasingly frustrated with a number of things it does and things it cannot do. And while Jekyll might not be for...

They live in large colonies (on average 700,000 ants), and during their moving phase they can organize large hunting raids which may contain more than 200,000 workers collecting...
